         Have you ever walked alone at night  ;
         Like a man against the world?  ;
         No one takes your side  ;
         A boat against the tide  ;
         When your faith is shaken, you start to break  ;
         And your heart can't find the words  ;
         Tossed upon the sand  ;
         I give you a man against the world  ;
         All the people cheer 'til the end is near  ;
         And the hero takes a fall  ;
         Then they'll drag you through the mud  ;
         You're only flesh and blood  ;
         Now I have walked the path from dark to light  ;
         And they've yet to come to terms  ;
         Alone I take my stand  ;
         I'm only a man against the world  ;
         But love like a distant reminder  ;
         It tugs at my shoulder, it calls me home  ;
         I shout, "Can a single voice carry  ;
         Will I find sanctuary within your arms?"  ;
         Someday when the answer's clearer  ;
         Someday when I even the score  ;
         You'll reach and you'll find me near you  ;
         Right beside you, forevermore  ;
         But for now I'll walk the night alone  ;
         Like a man against the world  ;
         A brand new day will shine  ;
         Through the avalanche of time  ;
         Now the road's grown long but the spirit's strong  ;
         And the fire within still burns  ;
         Alone I take my stand  ;
         I give you a man against the world  ;
