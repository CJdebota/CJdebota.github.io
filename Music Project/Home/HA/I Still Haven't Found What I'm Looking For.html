            <p>
                I have climbed highest mountains  ;
                I have run through the fields  ;
                Only to be with you  ;
                Only to be with you  ;
                I have run   ;
                I have crawled  ;
                I have scaled these city walls  ;
                These city walls  ;
                Only to be with you  ;
                But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  ;
                But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  ;
                I have kissed honey lips  ;
                Felt the healing in her fingertips  ;
                It burned like fire  ;
                This burning desire  ;
                I have spoke with the tongue of angels  ;
                I have held the hand of a devil  ;
                It was warm in the night  ;
                I was cold as a stone  ;
                But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  ;
                But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  ;
                I believe in the kingdom come  ;
                Then all the colors will bleed into one  ;
                Bleed into one  ;
                But yes I'm still running  ;
                You broke the bonds  ;
                And you loosed the chains  ;
                Carried the cross  ;
                Of my shame  ;
                Oh my shame  ;
                You know I believe it  ;
                But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  ;
                But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  ;
                But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  ;
                But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  ;
